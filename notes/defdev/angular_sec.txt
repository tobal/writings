Angular 1.0 security

rendering:
- read html
- interpret directives
- data retrieved via dynamic json resources

angular is more secure than react

declarative prog for UI
imperative for business logic

security:
- strict contextual escaping (stop xss)
- html sanitization
- json hijacking protection
- double cookie submit csrf prot
- content security support

automatic escaping to stop xss
- it's hard to get right
- escaping is -> makes data out of executable code
