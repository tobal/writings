you should not rely only on input validation
it is only a gatekeeper

you should validate:
- user input
- os resources
- external resources

what is user input:
- http parameters
- headers
- cookies
- body content
- basically everything

client side vs server side validation
- client exists to help the user
- server is the effective layer
- server exists for preventing malformed data input

Normalization

Serialization
- very dangerous

Validation methods:
length check (can mitigate shellcode injection)
white listing
black listing (not wise to do)
type checking
input rejection
