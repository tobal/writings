string assembly is the problem, so use parameterized query

attacker can:
- data retrieval
- data modification
- database specific exploits

won't work:
- stored procedure
- escaping quotes (numerical sqli)

advanced sqli:
- timing attacks
- sql server: waitfor delay
- measure the delay, get data char by char

defense
- validation is not enough, and hard too
- it's not the language what matters
- good: parameterized query -> the database will run the query and bind the parameters in separate steps

configuration:
- turn off as many features as possible
- EXECUTE on stored procedures
- SELECT on system tables


Other injections

arbitrary file upload
- upload a malware
- overwrite system files

file path traversal attacks

defense: object (file) lookup maps and access control
- don't use the user input as a real path
